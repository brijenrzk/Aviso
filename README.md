This project focuses on the development of a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform for real- time analysis of PDF and audio documents, leveraging advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance document management and user interactions. The platform aims to address the challenges faced by users in handling large volumes of documents by providing tools for efficient information retrieval, content summarization, and interactive document interactions.

Key features of the platform include AI-powered answers to user queries, interactive document interactions, secure user authentication mechanisms, and robust data storage capabilities. By incorporating state-of-the-art technologies like Next.js, React, Prisma, tRPC, and Tailwind, the project seeks to deliver a seamless and modern user experience, catering to diverse user needs and preferences.

Through a tiered subscription model offering both free and Pro Tiers, the platform aims to provide essential features for all users while offering advanced capabilities to subscribers. Integration with Stripe payment services ensures a secure and reliable payment system for users accessing premium features.
